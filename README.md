# TextVentura
Created as a project for a subject in my university education and graded with honors, TextVentura is an engine that allows you to create terminal-based interactive fiction games in a simple way through the editing of a single .dat file.

In TextVentura, you can create rooms and objects with rich descriptions, as well as doors that block the way until the appropriate object is used. The engine supports intricate object-collecting based puzzles and immersive storytelling, providing a robust foundation for your interactive fiction projects.

Being open-source and featuring simple, well-documented code, TextVentura is highly adaptable to the needs of your project. Whether you're a novice developer or an experienced programmer, you can easily modify and extend the engine to suit your creative vision.

In the following repository, you can find an example of a simple game created with TextVentura. Simply replace the .dat file to try it out and see the possibilities for yourself.
